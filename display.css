/* things I would do if I would prepare for a Frontend Engineer Role !!!

1. Build a portfolio website. A portfolio is like a live demo of how your work looks like. It need not include fancy animations and games but a simple portfolio including your basic details and your projects is good enough.

2. Add at least one complex project to your resume. A complex project is one which has multiple concepts used in a single project.

For example - you can build a social media clone that is basic and everyone would do that but including a chat feature into it using socket OR building an infinite comment section below the posts would be things that will differentiate you from others.

3. Host your projects. Live project is the easiest way to showcase your skills. People might say that it is optional but it makes a huge difference in resume selection and interview.

Has any of this helped you crack a frontend developer job? Or anything you want to add in this list !!!
